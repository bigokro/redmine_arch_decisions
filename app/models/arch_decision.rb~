# An "Arch Decision" is a decision about the architecture (or a design decision) which will either have a big impact
# on the project architecture/design, which requires serious discussion between project members, which requires
# some permanent record of why the decision was made, or all of the above.
#
# Arch Decisions should generally be made based on a set of validated and prioritized Factors.
