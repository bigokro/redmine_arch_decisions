# A Factor is some piece of information that is relevant enough to one or more projects that it will influence the
# (technical) decisions made for that project. Factors can be listed inside an ArchDecision, but their scope may
# go well beyond the single decision, or even the project itself (for example, a piece of information regarding
# security issues with a specific framework might be relevant to all projects that use that framework).
#
# Many things can be recorded as factors:
#   - Functional Requirements
#   - Non-functional requirements (e.g. the Quality of Service attributes, or "-ilities")
#   - Project constraints (e.g. legal issues, project budget, project risks)
#   - Human factors (e.g. the "boss's" general preferences, political issues (be careful what you say in public!))
#   - Technical constraints (e.g. weaknesses and strengths of technologies)
#
# Factors are basically facts (or factoids, or supposed facts) that someone has offered up as a basis for a decision.
# The universe of possible Factors is infinite, so it would not make sense to record every possible one.
# Instead, the point is to elevate assumptions and rationale for potential decisions (i.e. ArchDecisions) into
# explicit (and, for the ArchDecision itself, prioritized) and validated reasons.
#
# As of version 0.0.7, Factors have a "scope" attribute that can be equal to one of the constant values below.
# Iff the scope is "Project", they will also have an associated project enitity.
# If the scope is "AD", they must have at most one AD associated with them (but no project)
